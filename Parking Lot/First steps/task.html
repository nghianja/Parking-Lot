<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Parking lots are an urban necessity: it's a place where you can leave your precious car without fear of it being stolen or towed. Modern car parking systems are automatized and capable or self-management. In this project, you will create a somewhat similar one, but in a simplified form.</p>

<p>Let's start by writing a program that can place your car in the parking lot and free that lot when the car leaves. This shall be the "skeleton" of our functional parking lot: we will add on to it in the following steps.  During busy hours, the parking lot may run out of vacant spaces. The program will provide us with aggregated information about the current state of the lot.</p>

<h2>Output example</h2>

<p>The first version of your program should just print the following:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">White car has parked.
Yellow car left the parking lot.
Green car just parked here.</code></pre>
