<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Now it's time to add some query commands.</p>

<p>The command <code>reg_by_color</code> prints all registration numbers of cars of a particular color, taking color as a parameter. The color may be written in uppercase or lowercase letters. For example: <code>reg_by_color BLACK</code>. The answer should contain registration numbers separated by commas. The order should be the same as in the <code>status</code><strong> </strong>command. If there are no cars with this color, the output should be like this: <code>No cars with color BLACK were found.</code>.</p>

<p>The command <code>spot_by_color</code> is similar to the previous one, but it prints all spot numbers of cars of a particular color.</p>

<p>The command <code>spot_by_reg</code> returns you the number of the spot where your car is located based on the registration number. For example: <code>spot_by_reg KA-01</code>. It can return an error message if your car was not found:  <code>No cars with registration number KA-01 were found.</code> For convenience, let's suppose that all car registration numbers are unique.</p>
