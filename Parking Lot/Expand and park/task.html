<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Two spots seems like a rather modest size for a parking lot, so let's increase the number of parking spaces. We'll jump straight to having 20 spots, numbered from 1 to 20. Initially, all the spots are vacant.</p>

<p>When the user wants to park the car, the program should find a parking spot with the lowest parking number.</p>

<p>The user can write commands <code>park</code><strong> </strong>and <code>leave</code><strong> </strong>repeatedly and type <code>exit</code> to end the program.</p>

<p>If the parking lot is filled and there's no room left, the program should type <code>Sorry, parking lot is full.</code>.</p>

<p>If there are several available spots for a car, the program should always assign the spot with the lowest number.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p> The symbol <code>&gt;</code> represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; park KA-01-HH-9999 White
White car parked on the spot 1.
&gt; park KA-01-HH-3672 Green
Green car parked on the spot 2.
...

&gt; park Rs-P-N-21 Red
Sorry, parking lot is full.
&gt; leave 1
Spot 1 is free.
&gt; park Rs-P-N-21 Red

&gt; exit</code></pre>
